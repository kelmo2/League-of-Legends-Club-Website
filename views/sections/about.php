		Hey guys! South Texas Summoners is a school organization at The University of Texas – 
		Rio Grande Valley that is wholly based off the free, online computer game, League of Legends.  
		For the past couple of years, this game has grown rapidly from the national level, to a worldwide scale; 
		thus, immerging an E-Sport known as the League Championship Series, or LCS. In due time, Riot Games had a 
		vision of supporting League of Legends-inspired organizations across all college campuses. In doing so, we 
		receive packages that include a very generous amount of premium merchandise, only available to collegiate 
		organizations. Our affiliation with RiotGames has supported us on numerous occasions for our local events, 
		and you can get in on all the awesome exclusive access too!

		Starting back in the fall semester of 2014, we strive to do our best for our gaming community 
		to which has grown immensely! We have been very active in hosting both online & LAN tournaments, 
		hosting online community nights (where we all just log on & casually play for fun), & LCS viewing 
		parties in addition to on-campus school events and fundraising. Our ultimate goal for this club is to 
		send a team of our members to represent our university & compete against other collegiate teams on a 
		national scale. In recent years, our sister university, The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M 
		have participated in these tournaments and have brought back an abundance of scholarships for participants 
		and the university. Who says playing video games won’t pay off!?!
