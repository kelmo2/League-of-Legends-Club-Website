			One of the biggest involvements we have with our club members are tournaments. 
			We have hosted both online and LAN tourneys that have all been great successes! 
			We’ve done regular 5v5’s on Summoner’s Rift, and even 3v3’s on Twisted Treeline. 
			These tournaments are only held once a month, depending on what we feel we can handle. In order to ensure RP 
			prizing from Riot, we have specific rules and 
			criteria that we must abide by and fulfill, the list below refers to the most immediate.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>There MUST be a minimum of 8 teams registered before the day of the tournament.</li>
			<li>There must always be a team captain when registering for the event</li>
			<li>TeamSpeak (VoIP) will be a required software to utilize between team captains, members, and tournament organizers.</li>
			<li>For LAN tournaments especially, only UTRGV students are allowed to participate and MUST have an account on the North American server. This is enforced for the sole reason of UTRGV students needing their campus credentials for accessing the school’s Wi-Fi connection.</li>
			<li>For ONLINE tournaments, any person outside of being a UTRGV student is allowed to compete and is NOT required to play on the North American server.</li>
			<li>
				Subs receive prizing IF, and only if, they subbed in for the last match of the tournament. Thus, the player that they 
				subbed for will NOT receive prizing for <b>we can only submit 5 names per team that placed.</b>
			</li>
