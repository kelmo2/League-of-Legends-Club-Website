			The utmost coolest thing about this whole experience of who we are and what we do is 
			being an official member of our organization. There are many advantages of being a 
			club member as we will explain below. However, the main priority we hope to fulfill 
			for each of our members is providing a friendly and chill atmosphere where we can freely 
			talk about one of our most passionate games: League! xD 
		</p>

		<p>Why become a member?</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Our membership payment of $10 will be good for the whole academic year</li>
			<li>For any tournament that we host, members will get a 50% discount off the entry fee that we will charge for participation</li>
			<li>Once we are finally stable with club funds, we will be able to provide free pizza to any meetings or events we’d want to do (paid members having priority)</li>
			<li>You will be able to purchase our club t-shirt that will sport our logo and will be encouraged to have once participating in any in-person club events like fundraisers or tournaments.</li>
			<li>We create an awesome networking system where players help out other players with friendly advice regarding champs, game strategies, or overall gameplay</li>
		</ul> 

		<p>Membership hours: Volunteering</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Throughout the year, we will be asking for your help! Donating materials that will be needed for fundraising or helping out with school events will earn you hours which will be documented or accumulated year round.</li>
			<li>Specifically, these hours will be achievable by attending LAN tournaments, volunteering at events, attending meetings, and designated fundraiser donations.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>What are these hours for?</p>

		<ul>
			<li>At the end of the academic year, we will be rewarding members that not only earned hours, but that we noted made outstanding effort to help out and participate in all events that we do.</li>
			<li>The person with the most hours will have a choice of receiving a legendary skin to your choosing or our highest achievable prize that we hold in our inventory of League swag.</li>
			<li>People that reached 2nd – 4th place in earning hours will receive our lower tiered inventory prizes (i.e, Caitlyn cupcake stress balls, League role lanyards, skin codes etc.)</li>
		</ul>
